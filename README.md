# python-REST-API

This is a simple rest api using Flask framework and SQLAlchemy database.

1. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

2. SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language released under the MIT License.

This will give you an overview about REST API development using the above technologies.
